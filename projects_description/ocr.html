                        This is a project we had to make as a final Data Driven Computing Assignment. <br>
                        The basics of the system were written by our lecturer.<br> We had to implement Dimensionality Reduction,
                        design the classifier and write an Error Correction function. <br>
                        Model produced by our code couldn't be bigger than 3 MB and the Python script
                        had to produce the correct result in less than 2 minutes. <br><br>

                        <h3> Feature Extraction </h3>
                        I used Principal Component Analysis to produce 10 dimensional 
                        features vectors from full train and test data. 
                        I computed 40 principal components and mean vector of train data 
                         and used them to project ‘centred’ train and test data onto the principal components.
                        <br><br>
                        <h3> Classifier </h3>
                        Since we need to perform classification on the noisy data, I decided to use 
                        the k-nearest neighbour classifier.   
                        Although this classifier decreased the percentage of correctness on the first 2 cleanest pages, 
                        it boosted performance on the more noisy ones, so overall my results significantly improved.
                        <br><br>
                        <h3> Error Correction </h3>
                        Since most of the words from the standard dictionary never appear in the common text, 
                        I've decided to use 2 other dictionaries – 
                        one with the most common words with apostrophes and the other one with 5000 the most frequent English words 
                        (sorted by frequency). <br>
                        I extracted each word from an array of labels and checked if it was in the dictionary. If not,
                        I tried to find the best possible match. I was looking in the dictionary for the first word of the same length as 
                        the extracted text, which differs from it by 1 character. If any match was not found and the text was long enough (>7),
                        I was looking for the words at the same length which differ by 2 (and eventually 3) characters. If nothing was 
                        found, I did not correct the labels, because I did not want to make blind guesses. It improved my performance on 
                        the noisy pages by around 1% per page.
