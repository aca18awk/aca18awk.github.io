                        The objective of this project was to create a software system to meet the needs of a 
                        publication system. 
                        The system was implemented in Java, included a database in MySQL and a user interface in Java Swing. <br>
                        The system supports different user roles having different access rights, 
                        and is robust to obvious cyber-attacks.

                        <h3>UI: </h3>
                        We spent a lot of time trying to improve user experience. <br>
                        We used MigLayout, which enabled us to create responsive and easy to use interfaces. 
                        Thanks to the modularity of the code we have written, 
                        we could easily reuse one interface many times. <br>
                        <img class="description_image2" src="images/java1.png" alt="AppView reused in author and reviewer interface">
                        <img class="description_image2" src="images/java2.png" alt="AppView reused in author and reviewer interface">
                        <br><br>
                        Next feature which improves the user experience is a drop-down menu at the top of each interface. 
                        It makes navigating through different pages much easier and faster. <br>

                        <img class="description_image3" src="images/java4.png" alt="Drop-down menu bar">
                        <div style="clear:both;"></div>                      
                        
                        <br><br>

                        <h3>Security: </h3>
                        We made sure that our system and the sensitive data provided by the users are safe but 
                        at the same time we did not want to decrease the user's experience from using our system
                        by implementing too many complex security features.
                        That is why, after many discussions, we have implemented the following features: <br><br>
                        In order to make users’ data secure we have decided to use SHA 512 hashing algorithm with 128 bit
                        salt to encrypt the password before it is sent to the database. 
                        Thanks to that no sensitive data is stored in the database in unchanged form. 
                        Additionally, log in details (hashed password, salt, username) are stored in the separate table. <br><br>
                        To make sure that getting and inserting data to the database is secure, 
                        we used prepared statements for all database queries. 
                        That means the query and the data are sent to the database server separately so we fully 
                        eliminated the risk of SQL injection. Additionally, we wrote one Query function which we 
                        reused several times for multiple prepared statements. Consequently, by avoiding repetitions
                        we made our system more efficient. Finally, to check if all functions are secure, each 
                        individual member of the team tested them in his own unique way.
