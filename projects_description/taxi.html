                        This was the biggest University project I've worked on. As a team of 7
                        we designed and developed a fully functioning software product for Taxi Company called 'Tweet a Ride'.
                        It was designed to help them manage the customers, cars and all the tweets where users ordered a ride. <br>

                        On the main webpage everyone could see the offer of Taxi Company (called 'Tweet a Ride'), 
                        create an account and log in. <br>
                        Logged Customers could see all the available promotions, history of rides and their account details.<br>
                        Logged Admins could see databases of Customers, Cars (available and currently taken) and other Admins 
                        and manipulate this data. They could also add new available promotions for individuals and all users.
                        Admin could also manage all the tweets which mentioned the Tweet a Ride company on twitter to order a ride.<br>
                        System automatically got all necessary data and asked if anything was missing. 
                        System also automatically added promotions to the user's accounts. <br><br>
                        I wrote most of the Front-end code with CSS, HTML and JavaScript. <br>
                        I also worked on Back-End using Ruby and I was responsible for Databases (SQLite). <br>
                        We made sure that all the data is secured properly by using hashing algorithms. <br>
                        Having developed the system, we spent a lot of time testing it (both manually and using testing tools 
                        like Cucumber).
