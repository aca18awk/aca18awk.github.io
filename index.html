                        Since the beginning of my studies I have tried to gain as much knowledge and experience as possible, not only by attending the lectures,
                        but also by participating in many different events, courses and societies.
                    </p>
                    <p>Modules, which were the most useful for me so far:</p>
                    <p>
                        Functional Programming (99%), <br />
                        Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures (92%), <br />
                        Foundations of Computer Science (91%), <br />
